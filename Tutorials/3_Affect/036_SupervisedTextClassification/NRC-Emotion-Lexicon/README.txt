I. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
----------------------

The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight emotions
(anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments
(negative and positive). The annotations were manually done through crowdsourcing.

This work was approved by the NRC Research Ethics Board (NRC-REB) under protocol number
2009-94. REB review seeks to ensure that research projects involving humans as
participants meet Canadian standards of ethics.

Companion lexicons -- the NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon and the NRC VAD Lexicon are available here:
http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html

Applications: The lexicon has a broad range of applications in Computational Linguistics, Psychology,
Digital Humanities, Computational Social Sciences, and beyond. Notably it can be used to:
- study how people use words to convey emotions.
- study how emotions are conveyed through literature, stories, and characters.
- obtain features for machine learning systems in sentiment, emotion, and other affect-related tasks and
  to create emotion-aware word embeddings and emotion-aware sentence representations.
- evaluate automatic methods of determining emotion intensities (using lexicon entries as gold/reference scores).
- study psychological models of emotions.
- study the role of emotional words in emotional sentences, tweets, snippets from literature.

III. PYTHON CODE TO ANALYZE EMOTIONS IN TEXT
--------------------------------------------

There are many third party software packages that can be used in conjunction with the NRC
Emotion Lexicon to analyze emotion word use in text. We recommend Emotion Dynamics:

	https://github.com/Priya22/EmotionDynamics

It is the primary package that we use to analyze text using the NRC Emotion Lexicon and
the NRC VAD Lexicon.  It can be used to generate a csv file with a number of emotion
features pertaining to the text of interest, including metrics of utterance emotion
dynamics. 

See this paper for an example of the use of the lexicon to analyze emotions in text:

IV. NRC EMOTION LEXICON IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES
--------------------------------------------

The NRC Emotion Lexicon has affect annotations for English words. Despite some cultural
differences, it has been shown that a majority of affective norms are stable across
languages. Thus, we provide versions of the lexicon in over 100 languages by translating
the English terms using Google Translate (August 2022).

The lexicon is thus available for English and these languages:

Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali,
Bosnian, Bulgarian, Burmese, Catalan, Cebuano, Chichewa, Corsican, Croatian, Czech,
Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, Frisian, Gaelic, Galician,
Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, HaitianCreole, Hausa, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong,
Hungarian, Icelandic, Igbo, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Kannada,
Kazakh, Khmer, Kinyarwanda, Korean, Kurmanji, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian,
Luxembourgish, Macedonian, Malagasy, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Maori, Marathi, Mongolian,
Nepali, Norwegian, Odia, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian,
Samoan, Sanskrit, Serbian, Sesotho, Shona, Simplified, Sindhi, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian,
Somali, Spanish, Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tajik, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai,
Traditional, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukranian, Urdu, Uyghur, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Welsh, Xhosa,
Yiddish, Yoruba, Zulu

Note that an earlier version included translations obtained in 2017. The current 2022
translations are markedly better. That said, some of the translations may still be incorrect
or they may simply be transliterations of the original English terms.


V. LEMMATIZATION AND OTHER TECHNIQUES THAT MAY BE BENEFICIAL
------------------------------------------------------------

The lexicon file can be used as is, but occasionally certain additional techniques can be
applied to make the most of it for one's specific application context.

1. LEMMATIZATION: The lexicon largely includes the base forms or lemmas of words. For
example, it may include an entry for 'attack', but not for 'attacks' or 'attacking'. In
many cases, such morphological variants are expected to have similar emotion scores. So
one can first apply a third-party lemmatizer on the target text to determine the base forms
before applying the lexicon. Note that lemmatization must be applied with care; for
example, while it it good to go from 'helplessness' to 'helpless' (they are expected to
have similar emotional connotations), 'helplessness' should not be lemmatized to 'help'
(they are expected to have markedly different emotional connotations). Further, various
factors such as tense and 'differing predominant senses for different morphological forms'
can impact emotionality. So benefits of lemmatization are limited, especially when
analyzing large pieces of text.

2. OTHER: Other techniques such discarding highly ambiguous terms (terms with many
meanings), or identifying most common terms in one's text and inspecting emotion entries
in the lexicon for those terms (and correcting entries where appropriate), etc. are also
good practice.


VI. FORMS OF THE LEXICON, FILES, AND FORMAT 
-------------------------------------------

1. NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt: Has annotations at WORD LEVEL. This is the
primary lexicon file used by the vast majority of users. The word-level lexicon was
created by taking the union of emotions associated with all the senses of a word (see form
4). This is the primary form of the lexicon, and is used by the vast majority of users.

Each line has the following format:
<term><tab><AffectCategory><tab><AssociationFlag>

<term> is a word for which emotion associations are provided;

<AffectCategory> is one of eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise,
sadness, joy, or disgust) or one of two polarities (negative or positive);

<AssociationFlag> has one of two possible values: 0 or 1. 0 indicates that the target word
has no association with affect category, whereas 1 indicates an association.


2a.  NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt: This file has the same first eleven
columns as the NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt.  Additionally, it has columns
pertaining to over 100 languages. Each of these columns lists the translations of the
English words into the corresponding language. For example, the column Japanese contains
the Japanese translations of the English words.  The translations were obtained using
Google Translate in August 2022.


2b. OneFilePerLanguage: This directory has the same information as in
NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt, but in multiple files -- one for each
language.  Each of these files has twelve columns. The first eleven columns are the same
as in NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt. Additionally, it has  a column for the
translation of the English words to a different language -- the language corresponding to
the file name.  So if one is interested only in the Japanese version of the lexicon, then
they can simply use Japanese-NRC-EmoLex.txt.


3. NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Senselevel-v0.92.txt: Has annotations at WORD-SENSE LEVEL.  This is
the original form of data annotation. The information from this file was aggregated to
create the word-level lexicon (described in bullet 1).

Each line has the following format:
<term>--<NearSynonyms><tab><AffectCategory><tab><AssociationFlag>

<term> is a word for which emotion associations are provided;

<NearSynonyms> is a set of one to three comma-separated words that indicate the sense of
the <term>. The affect annotations are for this sense of the term.

<AffectCategory> is one of eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise,
sadness, joy, or disgust) or one of two polarities (negative or positive);

<AssociationFlag> has one of two possible values: 0 or 1. 0 indicates that the target word
has no association with affect category, whereas 1 indicates an association.

lexicon is available.

ENCODING: The lexicon files were created using UTF-8 encoding. You can view the lexicon files using
most text editors, Microsoft Excel, etc. You might have to make sure that the viewer
supports characters from various languages, i.e., set the encoding option in the viewer to
UTF-8, etc.  For example, to view in excel, follow these steps:

- open excel
- click on File -> Import
- select file type as 'Text file'
- select the lexicon file to import in the dialog box that opens up
- select 'File Origin' type as 'Unicode (UTF-8)'
- click 'Finish'

X. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------

Please see the papers below (included with the download) for ethical considerations
involved in automatic emotion detection and the use of emotion lexicons. (These also act
as the Ethics and Data Statements for the lexicon.)

- Ethics Sheet for Automatic Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis.
Saif M. Mohammad. Computational Linguistics. 48 (2): 239â€“278. June 2022.

- Practical and Ethical Considerations in the Effective use of Emotion and Sentiment Lexicons.
Saif M. Mohammad. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.03492. December 2020.

Note that the labels for words are *associations* (and not denotations). As noted in the
paper above, they are limited by when the dataset was annotated, by the people that
annotated them, historical perceptions, and biases. (See bullets c through h in the
paper). It is especially worth noting that identity terms, such as those referring to
groups of people may be particularly prone to inappropriate biases. Further, marginalized
groups have historically faced more negative perceptions. Thus some terms that are
associated with marginalized groups may be marked as having associations with negative
emotions by the annotators. For example, group X marked as being associated with negative
emotions could imply that they have historically faced negative emotions or that some
people have negative associations with group X, or there is some other reason for the
negative association. The exact relationship is not listed in the lexicon. In order to
avoid misinterpretation and misuse, and as recommended generally in the ethical
considerations paper, we have removed entries for a small number of terms (about 25) that
are associated with identity groups. For the vast majority of sentiment and emotion
analysis requirements this removal will likely have no impact or will be beneficial.

The list of identity terms used is taken from this list developed in 2019 on an offensive
language project (abusive language is often directed at some identity groups):

https://github.com/hadarishav/Ruddit/blob/main/Dataset/identityterms_group.txt

Only some of these terms occurred in our lexicon. This is not an exhaustive list; users
may choose to filter out additional terms for their particular task. We also welcome
requests for removal of additional terms from the list. Simply email us with the term or
terms and reason for removal.
