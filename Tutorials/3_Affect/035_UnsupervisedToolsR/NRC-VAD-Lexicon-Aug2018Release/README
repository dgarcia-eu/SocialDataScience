Words play a central role in language and thought. Several influential factor analysis studies have shown that
the primary dimensions of word meaning are valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD). 
- valence is the positive--negative or pleasure--displeasure dimension; 
- arousal is the excited--calm or active--passive dimension; and 
- dominance is the powerful--weak or 'have control'--'have no control' dimension.

The NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) Lexicon includes a list of more than 20,000 English words and
their valence, arousal, and dominance scores.  For a given word and a dimension (V/A/D), the scores range from
0 (lowest V/A/D) to 1 (highest V/A/D).  The lexicon with its fine-grained real-valued scores was created by
manual annotation using best--worst scaling.  The lexicon is markedly larger than any of the existing VAD
lexicons. We also show that the ratings obtained are substantially more reliable than those in existing
lexicons. (See associated paper for details.)

Despite some cultural differences, it has been shown that a majority of affective norms are stable across
languages. Thus we provide versions of the VAD lexicon in over one hundred languages by translating the
English terms using Google Translate (July 2018).

Applications: The NRC VAD Lexicon has a broad range of applications in Computational Linguistics, Psychology,
Digital Humanities, Computational Social Sciences, and beyond. Notably it can be used to:
- study how people use words to convey emotions.
- study how different genders and personality traits impact how we view the world around us.
- study how emotions are conveyed through literature, stories, and characters.
- obtain features for machine learning systems in sentiment, emotion, and other affect-related tasks and 
  to create emotion-aware word embeddings and emotion-aware sentence representations.
- evaluate automatic methods of determining V, A, and D (using NRC VAD entries as gold/reference scores).
- study the interplay between the basic emotion model and the VAD model of emotions.
- study the role of high VAD words in high emotion intensity sentences, tweets, snippets from literature.

This study was approved by the NRC Research Ethics Board (NRC-REB) under protocol number 2017-98. REB review
seeks to ensure that research projects involving humans as participants meet Canadian standards of ethics.

FILES AND FORMAT
----------------

1. NRC-VAD-Lexicon.txt: This is the main lexicon file with entries for 20,0007 English words. It has four columns
(separated by tabs):
- Word: The English word for which V, A, and D scores are provided. The words are listed in alphabetic order.
- Valence: valence score of the word
- Arousal: arousal score of the word
- Dominance: dominance score of the word

2. The directory 'OneFilePerDimension' has the same information as in NRC-VAD-Lexicon.txt, but in multiple files
-- one for each dimension: 
- v-scores: Includes valence scores. The words are sorted in decreasing order of valence.
- a-scores: Includes arousal scores. The words are sorted in decreasing order of arousal.
- d-scores: Includes dominance scores. The words are sorted in decreasing order of dominance.

3. NRC-VAD-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt: This files has the same first four columns as the NRC-VAD-Lexicon.txt.  
Additionally, it has columns pertaining to over 100 languages. Each of these columns
lists the translations of the English words into the corresponding language. For example, the column
Japanese-ja contains the Japanese translations of the English words. ('ja' is the ISO-639-1 Code for
Japanese.) The translations were obtained using Google Translate in July 2018. Occasionally, Google Translate
fails to provide a translation. In such cases, the file shows "NO TRANSLATION" instead of the translation.

4. The directory 'OneFilePerLanguage' has the same information as in NRC-VAD-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt,
but in multiple files -- one for each language.  Each of these files has five columns. The first column is for
the English words. The second column is the translation of the English words to a different language -- the
language corresponding to the file name. The third, fourth, and fifth columns are for valence, arousal, and
dominance scores.  So if one is interested only in the Japanese version of the NRC VAD Lexicon, then they can
simply use Japanese-ja-NRC-VAD-Lexicon.txt.

5. VAD-ACL2018.pdf: The research paper describing the NRC VAD Lexicon.

You can view the lexicon files using most text editors, Microsoft Excel, etc. You might have to make sure that
the viewer supports characters from various languages, i.e., set the encoding option in the viewer to UTF-8, etc.
For example, to view in excel, follow these steps:
- open excel
- click on File -> Import
- select file type as 'Text file' 
- select the lexicon file to import in the dialog box that opens up
- select 'File Origin' type as 'Unicode (UTF-8)'
- click 'Finish'

VAD-ACL2018.pdf will require a suitable pdf reader such as Acrobat or Preview.

For important ethical considerations in the use of the lexicon.

Note that the labels for words are *associations* (and not denotations). As noted in the paper above, they are limited by when the dataset was annotated, by the people that annotated them, historical perceptions, and biases. (See bullets c through h in the paper). It is especially worth noting that identity terms, such as those referring to groups of people may be particularly prone to inappropriate biases. Further, marginalized groups have historically faced more negative perceptions. Thus some terms that are associated with marginalized groups may be marked as having associations with negative emotions by the annotators. For example, group X marked as being associated with negative emotions could imply that they have historically faced negative emotions or that some people have negative associations with group X, or there is some other reason for the negative association. The exact relationship is not listed in the lexicon. In order to avoid misinterpretation and misuse, and as recommended generally in the ethical considerations paper, we have removed entries for a small number of terms (about 25) that are associated with identity groups. For the vast majority of sentiment and emotion analysis requirements this removal will likely have no impact or will be beneficial. 

The list of identity terms used is taken from this list developed in 2019 on an offensive language project (abusive language is often directed at some identity groups):
https://github.com/hadarishav/Ruddit/blob/main/Dataset/identityterms_group.txt
Only some of these terms occurred in our lexicon. This is not an exhaustive list; users may choose to filter out additional terms for their particular task. We also welcome requests for removal of additional terms from the list. Simply email us with the term or terms and reason for removal.
