# What is the aim of Social Data Science?

> The aim of Social Data Science is   
**the Quantitative Understanding of Human Behavior**.  

- **Quantitative:** As opposed to qualitative or descriptive, we aim for robust findings grounded in strong evidence that can be quantified.  

- **Understanding:** Not just predicting, we want to be able to generalize and combine knowledge, and even to motivate interventions or policies.  

- **Human:**  We will not study particles or objects. Measurement validity and ethics will be a challenge.  

- **Behavior:** Observable changes, structures, dynamics, and patterns; not just stories or theories

#  How are we going to do it?
**Retrieving, processing, analyzing, and interpreting Digital traces.**

# What is data?

> **Data:** Facts in the form of stored and transmittable information.  

- *Data* is the plural of the Latin word *datum*. *Data* means ”given (things)”.  
- Data is given to us, it is not fabricated nor simulated.

**Data Science** is the application of methods from Computer Science and Statistics to empirical questions and practical problems.

**Social Data Science** is the application of Data Science to study human behavior and social interaction. 

- Importance of combining methods, synthesis, and communication
- Gathering digital traces with Computer Science techniques
- Analysis interpretation with respect to what is known in the relevant Social Sciences

# Why digital traces?

Data from digital traces have six properties that can complement other traditional data sources in the social sciences:

- **Big Data:** Observing large amounts of humans across demographics  

- **Fast Data:** Quantifying aspects of human behavior in real time  

- **Long Data:** Retrieving longitudinal data and at various timescales  

- **Deep Data:** Gathering persistent information on individuals  

- **Mixed Data:** Combining heterogeneous datasources and unstructured data  

- **Strange Data:** Locating small subcommunities or deviant behavior

# What are the limitations of digital traces?

With the great potential of digital traces, aslo come great challenges:

- **Platform biases:** caused by their design, algorithms, social bots, etc

- **Data gatekeepers:** Not everyone can access some data sources

- **Performative behavior:** Talking online is not the same as offline.

- **Representativity issues:** Not everyone leaves digital traces. 

- **Observational data:** Testing causal mechanisms is not straightforward. 

- **The data deluge:** Too much data enables black-box predictions that can be useful but limit our understanding.

### The importance of questions in Social Data Science
