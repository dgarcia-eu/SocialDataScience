# Inequality and gender in social media

- The Internet as the Great Potential Equalizer (Hargittai & Hsieh 2013): 
  - Providing opportunities and  information access to everyone?

- "Unequal distribution of Internet access might exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities."
<div style="text-align: right"> <em property="italic"> World Bank: World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends </em></div>

- "One in five female Internet users live in countries where harassment and abuse of women online is extremely unlikely to be punished."

## The Facebook Ads API in demographics

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=800, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FBAPI.png")
```
- Programmatic Interface to automate marketing campaign in Facebook
- Audiences can be tuned by demographic attributes (gender, age, income...) or interests (sports, political parties, entertainment...) 
- Accessible for everyone with a Facebook account - audience metrics for everyone
- Used in demographics and development research (e.g. [Zagheni, Weber, & Gummadi, 2017;](https://doi.org/10.1111/padr.12102) [Mejova et al., 2018;](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3209811.3212698) [Fatehkia, Kashyap, & Weber, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18300883))
- Python package to use it: https://github.com/maraujo/pySocialWatcher

## The Facebook Gender Divide 

$R_{g,c}$: Ratio of Facebook active users of gender *g* over all inhabitants of gender *g* in country *c*

<center>

Facebook Gender Divide for country c:  
<br>$$FGD_c= log\left(\frac{R_{Male,c}}{R_{Female_c}}\right)$$</center>

Validation with survey data:
- FGD (217 countries)
- Global Web Index (34 countries)
- Pew Internet research (19 countries)

# Basics: Linear Regression

Regression models formalize an equation in which one numeric variable $Y$ is formulated as a linear function of other variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, etc: <center>
$Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3 X_3 ... + \epsilon$
</center>
- $Y$ is called the dependent variable

- $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, etc are called independent variables

- $a$ is the intercept, which measures the expected value of $Y$ that does not depend on the dependent variables

- $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, etc are called the slopes or the coefficients

- $\epsilon$ are the residuals, the errors of the equation in the data

## The FGD and offline gender inequality

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1100, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FGDreg.jpg")
```
- Regression of FGD rank on WEF gender indices and controls
- Most explanatory variable: Education Gender Equality

## The FGD and changes in gender inequality

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=550, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FGDdelta.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
- Changes in FGD and WEF gender equality indicators (2015-2016)
- FGD in 2015 improves prediction of changes in economic gender equality
- The reverse case is not present
- Not observable for other equality indices

On average, countries with high FGD rank 
in 2015 (low FGD) tended to approach economic gender equality in 2016

## Positive externalities in Facebook use

```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=550, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Scaling.png")
```
]
- Superlinear scaling of activity ratio versus total penetration
- Positive externality: value of using Facebook grows with other people using it

---

## The Facebook Gender Divide: Summary

- Measure of gender divide with FB data comparable to surveys
- This measure captures offline gender equality indices across countries
- Temporal correlation between FGD and changes in economic gender eq.
- Superlinear scaling of FB activity with penetration: positive externality

Social media might also work as a *digital provide*. Is Facebook helping women to find employment in countries with high gender inequality?
