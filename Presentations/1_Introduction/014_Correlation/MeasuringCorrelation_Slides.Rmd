# Some univariate statistics notation


- $X$ is a random variable
  - In data: $X_i$ is the value of the variable for entry $i$
  - For example the GDP of a country

- $E[X]$ is the expected value of $X$
  - We estimate the expected value as the mean of $X$: 
  $$\mu_X = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i X_i$$
  - $N$ is the number of data points, for example the number of countries

# Some more univariate statistics notation

- $V[X]$ is the variance of $X$
  - We calculate it as the expected squared difference to the mean X: 
  $$V[X] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i (X_i - \mu_X)^2$$
  - It is measured in squared units of $X$

- $\sigma_X$ is the standard deviation of X
  -  $\sigma_X = \sqrt{V[X]}$, which is convenient because it measures dispersion in the same units as $X$
  - in R you can calculate it with the function sd()

## Pearson's Correlation Coefficient $\rho(X,Y)$

> **Correlation:** Linear association or dependence between the values of variables $X$ and $Y$
 
- If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, they satisfy that the expectation of the product equals the product of expectations:  
$$E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]$$  
- The principle: correlation as the deviation from $E[XY] − E [X]E[Y] = 0$  
- The absolute value of this difference can be at most $\sigma_X\sigma_Y$  
- $\rho(X,Y)$ rescales the difference to be between −1 and 1  

$$\rho(X,Y) = \frac{E[XY] − E [X]E[Y]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$

Independent variables will have a correlation close to zero, but a correlation close to zero does not mean independence
