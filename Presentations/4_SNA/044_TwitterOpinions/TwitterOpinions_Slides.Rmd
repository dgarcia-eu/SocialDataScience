# Politicians on Twitter

.pull-left[![](GermanPoliticians.png)]

.pull-right[
- Example of social network among German Politicians on Twitter
[from Lietz et al, 2014](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/viewPaper/8069)

- Nodes are the Twitter accounts of politicians

- Directed links link a politician that follows another

- Node color corresponds to the party of a politician

- Force-directed layout

## Predicting the German elections with Twitter
.center[![:scale 55%](tweetsElection.png)]

- German election Twitter prediction, from [Tumasjan et al, 2010](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM10/paper/view/1441)
- Same ranking, prediction errors on average less than 2%! 
- "the mere number of messages reflects the election result and even comes close to traditional election polls". Why are we still using traditional surveys?

# The Victory of the Pirate Party

.center[![](ElectionsFail.png)]

- Study replication by [Jungherr et al, 2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439311404119?journalCode=ssce). 
- Not to judge parties beforehand, they included the Pirate Party too, not just the six most voted parties in the previous election. 
- The Pirate Party would have won by landslide, with almost double the mentions the second party got on Twitter

## Comparing original results and replication

```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F, fig.width=14, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
df <- read.csv("ElectionPrediction.csv", sep="\t")
g1 <- ggplot(aes(x=Twitter1, y=result), data=df) + geom_point() + geom_text(label=df$Party, hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.5, size=7) + theme_bw() + xlab("Twitter prediction 1 (%)") + ylab("Election result") + xlim(c(3,35)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F,col=rgb(0,0,0,0.25)) + theme(text = element_text(size = 30))
g2 <- ggplot(aes(x=Twitter2, y=result), data=df) + geom_point() + geom_text(label=df$Party, hjust = "inward", nudge_x = c(0,rep(0.5,5),-0.5),size=7) + theme_bw() + xlab("Twitter prediction 2 (%)") + ylab("Election result")+ xlim(c(3,35)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col=rgb(0,0,0,0.25))+ theme(text = element_text(size = 30))
g1 + g2
```

Jugherr and colleagues found other issues with the original prediction, for example how small changes in the dates considered for the analysis had a dramatic impact on the results.
