### Psycholinguistics: How individuals use and adopt language

.center[![:scale 60%](Communication.jpg)]   

**De Saussure's model of language**
- Language as association between signified (meaning) and signifier (word)
- Associations are normative and agreed through learning
- Human communication is composed of two steps: 
  1. **Encoding:** Transforming thoughts into words
  2. **Decoding:** Translating words into thoughts

# Connotative vs denotative meanings

![:scale 45%](dictionary.jpg) ![:scale 45%](hands.jpg)


- **Denotative meaning:** Definition of a word in reference to other meanings
- **Connotative meaning:** Emotional association of the use of a word
- Sentiment analysis aims to measure the **connotative meaning** of texts

# The Semantic Differential

**Charles Osgood's Semantic Differential:**
 Rating scales to measure the connotative meanings of words, objects, events (or symbols in general)

Osgood's method to find the dimensions of meaning:

  1. Select a set of objects/words/symbols to measure their meaning
  2. Design a large set of questions or scales about the symbols
  3. Ask some people to rate the symbols according to the scales
  4. Apply dimensionality reduction/factor analysis
  5. Interpret factors into dimensions of meaning

*The measurement of meaning. C. Osgood, G. Suci, P. Tannenbaum, 1957*

# Word ratings for the semantic differential

.center[![:scale 45%](WordRatings.png)]   


- Stimulus: One word, in this case *polite*
- Response: Ratings of each participant for the word in relation to adjectives

## Dimensionality reduction: Factor analysis
.center[![:scale 70%](PCA.jpg)]

- The N-dimensional cloud of (average) ratings of words is processed with factor analysis
- Each factor is a vector in the N-dimensional space. Factors are orthogonal
- Factors are ordered such that the first one has the most variance
- The result is a smaller set of dimensions that represents the ratings of words to certain extent (explained variance)

# Three dimensions of meaning

.pull-left[.center[![:scale 75%](SD.jpg)]]

.pull-right[

The dimensions of the Semantic Differential (EPA):
- **Evaluation:** good, desirable -- bad, undesirable
- **Potency:** strong, powerful -- weak, powerless
- **Activation:** active, fast -- passive, slow]

- Evaluation has the most variance, i.e is the most explanatory
- Potency and Activation have similar explanatory level below Evaluation
- More advanced methods in NLP can extract more nuanced representations of meanings: Latent Semantic Annotation, word embeddings, etc
