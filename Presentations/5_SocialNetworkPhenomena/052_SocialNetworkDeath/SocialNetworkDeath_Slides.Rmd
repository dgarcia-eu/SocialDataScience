# The rise and fall of Friendster

**Friendster** went from 80 Million active users to disappear completely.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=15, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE, cache=T}
library(gtrendsR)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
trend <- gtrends("Friendster", time="all")
trend$interest_over_time %>% filter(hits!="<1") %>% mutate(hits=as.numeric(hits)) -> interest
ggplot(interest, aes(x=date, y=hits)) + geom_line() + ylab("Google search volume") + xlab("Date") + ggtitle("Friendster") + theme_bw() + theme(text = element_text(size = 30))
```

# The rise and fall of MySpace

**MySpace** went from being valued more than 12 Billion USD in 2008 to be bought by [Justin Timberlake for 35 Million USD](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/30/myspace-internet). 

```{r echo=F, fig.width=15, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE, cache=T}
trend <- gtrends("MySpace", time="all")
trend$interest_over_time %>% filter(hits!="<1") %>% mutate(hits=as.numeric(hits)) -> interest
ggplot(interest, aes(x=date, y=hits)) + geom_line() + ylab("Google search volume") + xlab("Date") + ggtitle("MySpace") + theme_bw()+ theme(text = element_text(size = 30))
```

# The rise and fall of Orkut

**Orkut** was the first attempt of Google to launch an online social network. It was very popular in some countries but lost users to Facebook and it was eventually taken offline.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=15, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE, cache=T}
trend <- gtrends("Orkut", time="all")
trend$interest_over_time %>% filter(hits!="<1") %>% mutate(hits=as.numeric(hits)) -> interest
ggplot(interest, aes(x=date, y=hits)) + geom_line() + ylab("Google search volume") + xlab("Date") + ggtitle("Orkut") + theme_bw()+ theme(text = element_text(size = 30))
```

---

# The Google+ spike

**Google+** was the much promoted second attempt at social networks by Google. Despite the initial hype, it lost users pretty quickly and it has been discontinued too.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=15, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE, cache=T}
trend <- gtrends("Google Plus", time="all")
trend$interest_over_time %>% filter(hits!="<1") %>% mutate(hits=as.numeric(hits)) -> interest
ggplot(interest, aes(x=date, y=hits)) + geom_line() + ylab("Google search volume") + xlab("Date") + ggtitle("Google+") + theme_bw()+ theme(text = element_text(size = 30))
```

# Stretching the Google trends method

Data scientists at Facebook [replied to the Arxiv paper](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mike-develin/debunking-princeton/10151947421191849/) showing the problem with measuring social network use levels using Google Trends data. Applying the same methodology, Facebook researchers reached the conclusion that Princeton would lose 80% of its students by 2021:

# Stretching the Google trends method

You can even apply it to air and come to the conclusion that the atmosphere will run out of air by 2060:

# Google trends for Facebook

The Facebook examples show that decrease in search volume is a decrease in information searching about the social network, not a decrease in access and use.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=15, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE, cache=T}
trend <- gtrends("Facebook", time="all")
trend$interest_over_time %>% filter(hits!="<1") %>% mutate(hits=as.numeric(hits)) -> interest
ggplot(interest, aes(x=date, y=hits)) + geom_line() + ylab("Google search volume") + xlab("Date") + ggtitle("Facebook") + theme_bw()+ theme(text = element_text(size = 30))
```

# Google trends for Twitter

Twitter is not living a second growth, in fact it's growth has been rather slow to stagnant for a few years, even though it appears it is gaining users after Trump's permanent suspension.

```{r echo=F, fig.width=15, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE, cache=T}
trend <- gtrends("Twitter", time="all")
trend$interest_over_time %>% filter(hits!="<1") %>% mutate(hits=as.numeric(hits)) -> interest
ggplot(interest, aes(x=date, y=hits)) + geom_line() + ylab("Google search volume") + xlab("Date") + ggtitle("Twitter") + theme_bw()+ theme(text = element_text(size = 30))
```

# Temporal validity issues

</br>
A more accurate way to measure activity in a social network is Bruno Ribeiro's [approach using Alexa data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2566486.2567984), but Alexa focuses on website visits without considering access through mobile apps. 


</br>
Measurement is always an important issue in Computational Social Systems, and just because a paper used a measurement method few years ago, it does not mean it is valid today.

> **Take home message:** Your measures based on today's digital traces might not work on tomorrow's
