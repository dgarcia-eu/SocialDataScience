## Approaches to Polarization

**Opinion polarization:** Two opinion groups with extreme distance in between

**Relational polarization:** Social structure divided into two groups with high internal connectivity and low inter-group connectivity

**Affective polarization:** Extreme support within groups and hate across groups

## EAT-Lancet and yes2meat: Summary

- We mapped the digital backlash to EAT-Lancet on Twitter through #yes2meat
- Birth of #yes2meat preceded the release of the report
- Four communities: pro-EAT-Lancet, skeptic, pro-yes2meat, and vegan
- Information flow from pro-yes2meat to skeptic community after report
- Diet polarization: liberal vegan vs conservative keto

Example of emerging polarization towards hyperpolarization as in Weighted Balance Theory
