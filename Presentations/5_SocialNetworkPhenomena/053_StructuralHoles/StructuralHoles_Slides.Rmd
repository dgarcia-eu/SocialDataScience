# Triadic closure

</div>

>  **Triadic closure:** The tendency of individuals in social networks to create links to neighbors at distance 2

**Local clustering coefficient**:

$$C_i = \frac{2*t(i)}{d_i *(d_i−1)}$$

- $d_{out}(i)$ is the outdegree of $i$ (>1) 
- $t(i)$ is the number of pairs of neighbors of $i$ that are connected
- can be averaged or computed globally

# The strength of weak ties

<div style="float:right">
<img src="strongTie.png" alt="A strong tie." width=400pt/>
</div>

**Strong ties:** People who are very close to you (family, friends, etc.)
- Provide reciprocal emotional support
- Long-lasting, require energy and time

**Weak ties:** People you know but not very close to you (colleagues from work, school, etc.)
- Provide information, for example about employment and housing
- Are also faster to disappear

> **The strength of weak ties:** Weak ties are weaker than strong ties, but are also many more than strong ties. (Mark Granovetter)

### Measuring modularity

The measure of [**modularity**](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577.short) quantifies the tendency of a network to be divided in densely connected subgroups that are sparsely connected across groups.   
**Q-modularity** measures this tendency:

$$Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{u,v} [ A_{u,v} - \frac{k_u k_v}{2m} ]\delta(c_u, c_v)$$
- $u$ and $v$ are two nodes of the network. The sum goes over all pairs of nodes.
- $m$ is the number of edges  
- $A$ is the adjacency matrix ($A_{u,v} = 1$ if and only if u and v are connected)  
- $k_u$ and $k_v$ are the degrees of $u$ and $v$  
- $c_u$ is the community of $u$ and $c_v$ is the community of $v$  
- $δ(c_u,c_v)$ takes value $1$ if and only if u and v are in the same community, otherwise it's $0$

## When holes are bridged: The small world concept

Small world networks have the following three properties:  
- Most nodes are not neighbors (sparse network)  
- The mean distance between two nodes is small  
- They have high global clustering coefficient

**Stanley Milgram's experiment:**

- 160 people in Omaha try to reach one person in Boston by mail to their acquaintances
- 44 letters reached the target with six steps on average
- Short path length as evidence of small-world
- **Guess: what is the average path length on Facebook?**
